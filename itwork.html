                <ol>
                    <li>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</li>
                    <p>My work is to provide on-going support for our end-users regarding to the IT problems during their work and operation. Our 'end-users' include every staff working in the company, I have to work with my team to serve their requests or issues relating to their computers and network in working area. On the other hands, we do have projects of different scales every year regarding to new hardware acquisition and setup, OS or software upgrade. For example, upgrade of the existing server systems for improving system performance, enhancing the system capacity, etc. All projects involve budgeting, planning and deployment.</p>
                    
                    <li>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</li>
                    <p>Our company is simply in Information Technology industry, providing tailor-made software platform & data solution to our customers as per their requirements. We capture data from different sources including web sites and specific data providers to our own database systems, and process the data so they could be presented to our customers as per their requirements.then we also provide and maintain the interface for our customers to access the data.</p>
                    
                    <li>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</li>
                    <p>Nothing else. </p>
                    
                    <li>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</li>
                    <p>I work with my team to serve all end-users of all departments in our company. Some of them are in the same office with us, the others are working in different offices, even different time-zones. They could make requests by emails or chatting software. Certainly there is priority when multiple requests happen, we have to handle the issues according to their severity or importance. For example, when all staff in the office find Internet connection disconnected, we have to respond immediately and take this as the top priority to get it fixed.</p>
                    
                    <li>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</li>
                    <p>In IT industry, we receive communication emails from different vendors or organization. They do provide some seminars, workshops or webinars, in which we could learn about new technology and stuff, and have the chance to meet different IT professionals from other companies or organization, trying to share any new technology or new systems being used. </p>
                    
                    <li>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</li>
                    <p>in my daily support work, when the end-users call for help, it could be requested by email, Skype chat, or phone calls when there is emergency in any time. For those who works remotely in different offices, we have to interact with them patiently in order to know what exactly the problem is, what the error message they encountered and what kind of symptoms, etc.</p>
                    <p>In some occasions, there are system maintenance or unexpected system down time, we have the responsibility to give notification to the affected users as early as possible.</p>
                    
                    <li>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</li>
                    <p>On-going daily support that including the routine check and fix of the systems in our backend.</p>
                    
                    <li>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</li>
                    <p>In IT daily support, the most challenging task could be the resume of systems which might be down due to hardware failure or even software system crash. Hardware failures, like failed hard disks that causes loss of data, it takes time to resume the system even data backup is available. Therefore, whenever possible, we need to plan and setup the high availability feature for those critical systems, e.g. our internal email system.</p>
                    
                    <li>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</li>
                    <p>Our team manages hundreds of servers. Thanks for the technology of virtual machines (VMs), we could build a server much easily, quickly and remotely. We have our own VM infrastructure which is formed by a numbers of powerful servers and disk storage that we purchased and setup to run in the data centers. Whenever it is necessary to setup a new "machine", we don't have to buy a new hardware shortly and install it physically, just remotely connect to our VM infrastructure in the data centers and allocate the resources (no. of CPU, memory and disk space) to build the new VM, then we may deploy the OS and applications to it. This dramatically reduces the deployment time, and it is easier to move the existing VM from the older hardware to the new one, all these can dramatically reduce the down time of the systems.</p>
