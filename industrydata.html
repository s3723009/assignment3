                <h3>Job Title</h3>
                <p> Our group’s ideal jobs include being a Network Security Engineer (Ming and Kyongsub), Ruby Virtual Reality Developer (Ethan), App developer/ Software Engineer (Huanghao and Junjie Chen), Game Designer (Ty). The job of a game designer demands the most experience compared to other jobs with the employer looking for 3 years experience in game development and demands the employee to have worked on at least 1 AAA shipped product. The job of being a Ruby Virtual reality also demands previous experience (minimum of 2 years) in working with Ruby on Rails. Becoming a Network Security engineer requires the employee to have a security qualification which is obtainable through university and have previous experience in dealing with networks and security. Becoming a software developer requires previous tertiary qualifications and 2-3 years of previous experience in all programming languages. As Huanghao’s ideal job is to become an entrepreneur, his job will require him to act as his own boss and requires leadership skills in order to lead his team to his goal. </p>
