                <h3><b>What does it do?</b></h3>
                <p>Clouds, services, servers, autonomous vehicles, robots and cybersecurity have been chosen. They will be introduced according to the topic requirements.</p>
                
                <p>First of all, in term of clouds, services and servers, the current technology is very mature and this can exchange information at high speed. Now it uses KVM and distributed storage methods. The future development of this technology will be to improve the group's processing. The temperature-resistance effect and computational density of the device, and the desire to improve these technologies requires a breakthrough in the production of materials and an increase in the deployment density of the computing processor.</p>
                
                <p>Secondly, autonomous vehicles, the technology has been listed on the market, has a good performance in a limited market, with the ability to go on the road and emergency response capabilities, to achieve breakthroughs in autonomous vehicles need to strengthen the emergency capabilities and accuracy. In the premise of improving the production materials and chip materials, there is still a need for better positioning capabilities in order to reduce the incidence of accidents and error rates. </p>
                
                <p>Thirdly, robots, with the advancement of the mechanical revolution and information revolution, the popularity of automation has become more and more common. At present, robots mainly appear in industrial and agricultural manufacturing, such as automatic production lines and automated grain harvesting systems. The development situation within three years will be based on popularization and more perfect deployment and management. Breaking through the robot's technological development, the most important is the development of AI technology. Through AI's core processor to control higher-efficiency and more-safer robots, the next more scientific deployment is a more important step.</p>
                
                <p>Lastly, cybersecurity, the improvement of this technology will be one of the most effective in 3 years. The previous network security relies solely on the firewall, but now has fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, pupil identification and so on. Accurately speaking, the breakthrough of network security requires two aspects, namely the improvement of the technical level and the enhancement of supervision. The former is reflected in the improvement of anti-virus software, the firewall can identify more Trojans and malicious software, and the latter is reflected in the strengthening of management. To make supervision work more meticulous and thorough, and strengthen the authenticity of network information. This not only requires a large number of samples to determine whether the software is malicious, but also requires Internet users to have a better awareness.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <h3><b>What is the likely impact?</b></h3>
                <p>There is no doubt that the development of IT  has positive impact on society and us human beings. The four sections chosen by our group will affect people all around the world especially those who live in urban cities. For example, more and more automatic cars will be appear in the market so that people can have relax more during their journey everyday. Clouds services will have more security and protect user’s privacy. Besides, the speed of download and upload will be much more faster. So people can have more private room to store or share their document. High speed will make it more efficient for humans by saving their time and energy. Robots can replace workers by doing their hard manual labour for them at a faster and more cost efficient method. With the development of robotic technology, many jobs will be overtaken by machines, instead, people will monitor and manage the machine. IT technology will make people more convenient, safe and efficient in every area. ln the near future, people will live with more smart and automatic equipment to benefit their lives.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <h3><b>How will this affect you?</b></h3>
                <p>With the development of these IT technologies, us as a society will have more private space to share information and interest. We can send messages more safely and efficient. Creativity will  lead the world so that our generation can avoid many tough and unwanted jobs. Instead, we can do much more innovative jobs. So, anyway, IT technologies will change the world a lot and play an important role in our daily lives and societies. We cannot live without IT technologies. In order for a Modern and intelligent world we need more technological skills and concepts. So we must learn how to be creative and how to create new innovations using creativity and imagination. We must prepare for the future and accept new innovations in technology as beneficial for society in the future . The first step to creating a better world is to start off accepting that the development of IT technologies is a must for humans to adapt to better lifestyles. </p>
