Our project is currently very limited as we currently don't have the skills required to create an actual functioning game. However, with the skills we currently have we have set our designs for the player model, customising the player model and even the application prototype. In order to create the game, our team members have to have knowledge of how to use Unity which we didn't although we've started on player movement.
