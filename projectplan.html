                <b>Topic</b>
                Our group aims to develop a mobile game called The Genius. The game involves multiple mind games where it tests the user's abilities to both play the games and to deceive the players around them. Basically, 4 players can play games together. Ultimately, more games will be added, so that multiple players (more than 4) can play in a game. The design is 2D-based and relatively simple compared to other new releasing games, but this game focuses on contents which users can enjoy.
                    
                    <br><br>
                The ultimate output is to enable users to enjoy their free time by playing the game with other players while slight brain exercise in short time. Every game should finish in 15 minutes designed for the mobile environment. Users can interact with each other with a chat or a voice chat, as well as build a small society in the game. 
<br><br>

                <b>Motivation</b>
                Our team was motivated to develop 'The Genius' due to our interest in gaming and one of the reasons we have decided to study IT in the first place. This project is interesting to us as this is the first time as a group that any of us have thought thoroughly about developing a game that isn't already on the market. This game fits in the mobile gaming trend as there is a massive surge in mobile gaming due to the technological society we live in where having a phone is a necessity. However not as detailed as console or PC games, mobile games provide an enjoyable and fun experience from the palm of their hands. 'The Genius' can display our creative talents in game design to future employers which can benefit employers with new ideas and creations.

<br><br>
                <b>Landscape</b>
                The current mobile gaming market consists of many varieties of games however there isn't an app that has the same features as 'The Genius' which is why we believe users will be curious about a new type of game being released. 'The Genius' can possibly open up a whole new market in mobile gaming. Moreover, this game is expected to consistently attract users’ interest by introducing a number of different mini games.

                <p>The goal of this game is for the best and smartest player to be crowned the winner and be rewarded with game currency. For the winner to be crowned he has to win all the mini-games. The game is set in a train with 3 carriages. 4 players will be on a train at the same time. The first mini-game starts in the first carriage with 4 players. One player will be removed at each stage.
                    <br><br>

                Each player will receive five garnets each at the beginning of the game. These garnets can be traded by players whenever they want (used for bribery e.g. paying another player to be on your side.), but this will be worth 100 points at the end of the game for the winner and 50 points for the losers. (if the last player has 20 garnets in total, he or she will receive 2000 BP (Brain Point) in the game.) This game money can be spent for decorating their avatars. Their game records will be stored in their profiles. Players will be matched with other players who have the similar rates.
