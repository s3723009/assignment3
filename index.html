                <h2> Group Process </h2>
                <p>Our process in Assignment 2 did not work well. The thing is that we could not collaborate with each other, because each of us took charge of each part. Then we just combined individuals’ work into one place. Thus, the overall assignment looked very mess and discordant. 
                    
                    <br><br>

                We changed our approach to Assignment 3. We have worked together for every single part instead of being in charge of each part. This could lead to more conflicts and take longer time to finish, but we believed this approach would produce better results. In addition to this, we started to use GitHub to share our work, even though the service is not yet familiar with us. Group chat has been more active than before.

                </p>
                
                <br><br>
                
                <h2> Career Plan  </h2>
                <p>The ideal jobs of each of our group members share a common ground of being part of the IT industry, albeit being largely different roles. These roles include being a Network Security Engineer (Ming and Kyongsub), Virtual Reality Developer (Ethan), App developer/Software Engineer (Huanghao), and Game Designer (Ty).  A common element that these roles share is that they all involve collaborative development of something via usage of computers, with the difference lying in the product of the development. 
                    <br><br>
                There are also differences in the collaborative roles; for example, the Game Designer would design and determine the framework of the project and how it will be developed, whereas the engineering roles would contribute their technical skills to realizing the products functionalities. 
                    <br><br>
                We tried to choose our roles for this project in a way that they reflect our ideal jobs. However, the development of the mobile game is not directly associated with network security and VR developing so some of us decided to try new fields. In an ever-changing industry such as IT, people have to adapt to changes and play different roles, even though these roles are totally irrelevant to their fields. In addition to this, people in the IT industry need to have a balance of a wide technical understanding. As a result of this collaborative project, we believe that we can learn about not only a basic knowledge of mobile gaming field, but also how teamwork has to work in IT project.
