The design of software is aimed at the minimum risk, but the existence of risk is often inevitable. For example, the software can not adapt to all mobile phones, such as display screen problems, and some apps on the market today are not able to adapt to the screen size of all mobile phones, just as the IPHONE X full screen is not compatible with all APPs. There may also be software compatibility issues, such as flashbacks, or stabling, and so on. As a game, we have reduced the graphics card requirements to a minimum, but there is no guarantee that it will be compatible. For example, some older phones may not be able to run after this software update many times due to compatibility issues caused by the low system version. There are other risks. For example, the rules of the game are different from other games of the same type. Therefore, the player may need several experiences to fully understand the victory mechanism. For example, the singleness of the game screen leads to aesthetic fatigue and so on. In summary, for the risk assessment of this software, we believe that it is mainly a system compatibility problem or a display problem.
