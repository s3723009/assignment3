Our software has to be designed to the lowest risk standards to design. Our software requirements for equipment are very low, and general smartphones on the market can be used. Without considering network and sudden equipment failures, we predict these risks. First, the game is different from the general game of the same type, so the player may need several experiences at the beginning to integrate into the game. Secondly, for the scene design of the game, we have adopted some relatively simple pictures and images, so players may experience some visual fatigue after long-term use. Third, the game's victory mechanism is mainly related to luck. Therefore, for some users, it will be relatively single and there is no room for special operation. In summary, we think that the risk of this software is very small and special, and each risk is actually to some people but not all players.
