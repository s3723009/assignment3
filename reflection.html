                <p><b>What went well:</b> Everyone tried to finish their individual duties.</p>
                <p><b>Improvement:</b> We had low participation in group work.</p>
                <p><b>Surprise:</b> One of our teammates is really good at coding, which gives me motivation to study harder.</p>
                <p><b>Learned about groups:</b> Our group member need to be pushed to finish work on time.</p>
                <p><b>Github log:</b> We were not familiar with Github yet. Everything has been processed with a different platform. </p>
            </fieldset>

                <p><b>What went well:</b> How the assignment comes together and completes on time.</p>
                <p><b>Improvement:</b> To polish the project more, perhaps need to look more professional.</p>
                <p><b>Surprise:</b> The project wasn’t as hard as expected. This allows us to complete with a leftover time to proof-read and check for improvement.</p>
                <p><b>Learned about groups:</b> That communication is the key for completion.</p>
                <p><b>Github log:</b> Everything went according plan.</p>

                <legend><h1> Ming Guan </h1></legend>
                <p><b>What went well:</b> The assignment went well and we were very organised which made us finish on time.</p>
                <p><b>Improvement:</b> Getting a group member to do more work or to understand what the assignment was even about.</p>
                <p><b>Surprise:</b> We all worked out together and everyone finished their tasks.</p>
                <p><b>Learned about groups:</b> Choosing the right members and having great teamwork and communication skills will lead the group to greatness.</p>
                <p><b>Github log:</b> We didn’t use github to track our activities however we used google docs which provides an alternative to see who’s done which section.</p>

                <p><b>What went well:</b> Finish on time and well done, group members are helpful and friendly.</p>
                <p><b>Improvement:</b> It needs more detail and it should have finished earlier. l must finish earlier!</p>
                <p><b>Surprise:</b> Too complete process on some part,so l will have more preparation.</p>
                <p><b>Learned about groups:</b> A group assignment is efficient. it is more necessary for us to join a group to do a project. I should more participate with my group members in the next assignment.</p>
                <p><b>Github log:</b> I do not like this one because it is hard to use and unfamiliar. Maybe after a short time, I hope that it will be fine.</p>

                <legend><h1> Huanghao (Harold) Li </h1></legend>
                <p><b>What went well:</b> Everyone can do their part well and have strong personal capabilities. The most important thing is that everyone can finish on time.</p>
                <p><b>Improvement:</b> We need more team discussion, such as more group meetings.</p>
                <p><b>Surprise:</b> We are really understanding.</p>
                <p><b>Learned about groups:</b> I am a person who likes to act alone, but I really like the atmosphere of this group. It's particularly relaxing. I can accomplish my tasks according to my own habits and plans. And they respect each other very much.</p>
                <p><b>Github log:</b> I am not very familiar with this software, I need to spend more time to familiarize with and adapt to this.</p>

                <p><b>What went well:</b> Each group member fulfilled their roles effectively as a result of clear communication.</p>
                <p><b>Improvement:</b> Time management on my part in inconvenient circumstances.</p>
                <p><b>Surprise:</b> Great cooperative group members, I could not have asked for more.</p>
                <p><b>Learned about groups:</b> Clear communication is must in group work. We have had difficulties conveying to certain members about what had to be done due to language barriers, but this was eventually solved as a result of clear and persistent explanations. When time is a problem, persistent and constant communication is what is needed to keep things together and to make the finished product consistent.</p>
                <p><b>Github log:</b> Not many of our group members are familiar with github, therefore we have stuck with the google docs that allows more consistent cooperative documenting.</p>
