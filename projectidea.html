                <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
                <h3><b>The Genius - Mobile Game</b></h3>
                <h3>Main Menu:</h3>
                <p>The game starts off in the main menu where players can choose the play, shop or customize option. The shop is used for players who want to convert their BP (Brain Points which is in-game currency) into outfits to customise their avatar, customise is for players who want to equip their outfits bought from the shop option and finally the play button which initiates the game to match you with 3 other players.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
                <p>There is a train with 3 carriages. 4 players will be in a train at the same time. The first mini game starts in the first carriage with 4 players. One player will be removed at each stage. There are 3 mini games in a train game, which is randomly chosen from plenty of different games.</p>
                                
                <p>Each player will receive five garnets each at the beginning of the game. These garnets can be traded by players whenever they want (used for bribery) , but this will be worth 100 points at the end of the game for the winner and 50 points for the losers. (if the last player has 20 garnets in total, he or she will receive 2000 BP (Brain Point) in the game.) This game money can be spent for decorating their avatars. Their game records will be stored into their profiles. Players will be matched with other players who have the similar rates.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <h4>First game</h4>
                <p>4 players will be divided into 2 teams randomly. They will be forced to talk only with their teammate for a minute and they will be allowed to come back to the lobby after a minute. Then, they will decide whether they will switch their teams or not, as well as choose which team will have more people. After 2 mins, they will know which members are in team A and team B. The members of the team with more players will win the game and receive 1 garnet each. Moreover, the players who expected which team will win also get 1 garnet. However, if there are 4 players in the same team, they will lose 2 garnets each. A vote will be initiated at the end of the game where players can vote for anyone to be removed from the game even if you are completely innocent so no one is safe.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <h4>Second game</h4>
                <p>The first player can select the digit from 1 to 3 at first. This rotates in a clockwise direction. The following players can decide how many number will be added to the previous digit (1~3). This keeps rotating until the number reaches 31. The player who has to select 31 not only will lose 2 garnets, but also will be removed. The other 2 players will obtain 2 garnets, respectively.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <h4>Final</h4>
                <p>There are 5 different cards which lay upside down. Each player will select one of them, but they do not know what they have chosen. They can only know which card their counterpart has chosen. The player who has more garnets will start betting with a garnet first. The other can bet a garnet or one more. This will keep going until their bets are the same. When their bets are the same, the cards will be opened to them and the player having a large number card will win. However, they can give up the game when they assume that they might lose. When one of the players give up the game, the player will be in the second place without losing any garnet. However, if the player has a card No.5, the player will have to give all the garnets to the other player.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>The game will end after the final match with the winner being crowned the king of the train and having his garnets transferred into BP and returned to the main menu.</p>
